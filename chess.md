We use the game of chess to help you develop and demonstrate mastery during this course. Your development work is divided into six different phases. Each phase demonstrates a different architectural concept or technology.

## Starter Code

âš  Each phase of the project comes with `starter code`. In order to make it easy to copy the starter files to your personal project repository, you should clone the course repository to your development environment.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/softwareconstruction240/softwareconstruction.git

```

## Example

When you complete the project, you should have something similar to the following.
