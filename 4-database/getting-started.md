# Getting Started

üìÅ [Starter code](starter-code)

The Starter Code has two folders, `dataAccess` and `serverTests`. Do the following:

1. Copy the `dataAccess` folder into your project‚Äôs `src/starter` folder. The `dataAccess` folder already exists in your project, but this will add more files to it.
1. Copy the `serverTests` folder into your project‚Äôs `src/test/passoffTests` folder. The `serverTests` folder already exists in your project, but this will add more files to it.

## Persistence Test

In your project‚Äôs `src/test/passoffTests/serverTests` folder there will now be a new class named PersistenceTest. This class tests that your server properly saves and loads data to/from your MySQL database. When this test runs, it first creates some data in your database by calling your server‚Äôs web APIs. Then, you will see a prompt in the IntelliJ test console window asking you to shut down your server, restart it, and then press `Enter`. By default, the IntelliJ test console window does not allow user input. If your test console window does not allow user input, do the following:

1. In IntelliJ go to the `Help` menu and select `Edit Custom VM Options‚Ä¶` This will load a text file in your editor that contains the Java virtual machine command line options that are used by IntelliJ.
2. Add the following line to this file and save it:

   ```sh
   -Deditable.java.test.console=true
   ```

3. Restart IntelliJ

Your test console window should now allow user input.

## Connect Database class to MySQL

Go to the Database class in your project‚Äôs `src/starter/dataAccess` folder and edit the `MYSQL_URL`, `DB_USERNAME`, and `DP_PASSWORD` fields to match the configuration of your MySQL server. This will allow you to use the Database class methods to manage a connection to your MySQL database.

## Dependencies

The only additional dependency you‚Äôll need to add for this project is the driver for connecting to MySQL.

- mysql:mysql-connector-java:8.0.29
  - Scope: Compile
